            from whole world, it will be correct to say that India is a land

            Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that
            originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically
            diverse India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and
            the Republic of India post-1947. The term also applies beyond India
            to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to
            India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in
            South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance,
            music, architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place
            within the country. Indian culture, often labelled as a combination
            of several cultures, has been influenced by a history that is
            several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization
            and other early cultural areas.Many elements of Indian culture, such
            as Indian religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages,
            dance, music, and movies have had a profound impact across the
            Indosphere, Greater India, and the world. The British Raj further
            influenced Indian culture, such as through the widespread
            introduction of the English language,[3] and a local dialect
            developed.
